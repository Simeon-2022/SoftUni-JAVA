        The "filler" text we know today has been altered over the years (in fact "Lorem" isn't actually a Latin word. It
        is suggested that the reason that the text starts with "Lorem" is because there was a page break spanning the
        word "Do-lorem". If you a re looking for a translation of the text, it's meaningless. The original text talks
        about the pain and love involved in the pursuit of pleasure or something like that.
